1.Teams
   a. Teams shuffle per week; Evenly divide a team's Dragon Balls between each team member. If uneven, figure it out.
   b. Battles are Team vs. Team unless they are out of office. Remaining team member can take extra shots to compensate.

2.Scoring
   a. Miss Fortune: Once per fight, each player can predict if an opponent will miss a shot (can't call on last shot). If they miss, the opponent loses their next shot. If they make it, it's worth 2 points instead of 1. Can't call "miss" on the same player in a fight.
   b. Punished if you lose to a PERFECT or artificial perfect from at least one opponent.

3.Challenges
   a. Each team has 1 daily forced challenge.
   b. You don’t have to accept after the 2nd daily challenge, but you can.
   c. Max 3 Dragon Ball(s) offered per fight

4.Usable if alive, each player starts each week with:
   a. 2 Saves – Works like Rolando’s.
   b. 1 KS – Save that can kill. Optionally call “Kill Steal” to take the rewards of winning the fight from the rightful winner. Teams can chain KS’s.
 
5.Win Condition: Tournament of Power
   a. All players participate as single players (if players will miss work for the rest of the week, teammates get an "extra life").
   b. Free for all challenges
   c. Saves/KS are legal. (Spend 3 saves to do a 1v2)
   d. Victory - At least one member of the “Lead” team remains, everyone else is knocked out
   e. Defeat – The “Lead” team is knocked out. The remaining players fight until there are 2 players remaining, and award 1 Dragon Ball to each player. (If there is 1 player left their team gets both).

6. Rules can change at the start of the week.
